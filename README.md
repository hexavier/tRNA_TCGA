# tRNA_TCGA

This repository includes the code upon submission used to reproduce the results and plots of the manuscript "Translational efficiency across healthy and tumor tissues is proliferation-dependent". Data used in the code must be first downloaded in a "data" subdirectory:
- Human codon usage from CoCoPUT: https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=codon_usage&id=576245
- Mapping files from UCSC: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/knownIsoforms.txt.gz; http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
- Isoform TCGA gene expression: http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/stddata__2016_01_28/data/
- CPTAC proteomics data from TCGA samples: https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptacPublic/
- tRNA expression, methylation and CNA: http://www.synapse.org/tRNA_TCGA
